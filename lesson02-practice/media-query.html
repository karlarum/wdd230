            <h2>1 Nephi 17:13</h2>
            <p>And I will also be your light in the wilderness; and I will prepare the way before you, if it so be that
                ye shall keep my commandments; wherefore, inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall be led
                towards the promised land; and ye shall know that it is by me that ye are led.</p>

            <h2>Alma 5:27</h2>
            <p>Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless before God? Could ye say, if ye were called to die at this
                time, within yourselves, that ye have been sufficiently humble? That your garments have been cleansed
                and made white through the blood of Christ, who will come to redeem his people from their sins?</p>
